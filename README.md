This is a simple command-line flashcard program designed to help users learn Spanish vocabulary.
The program allows the user to choose a specific category of words to practice from a list of available categories.
Upon running the program, the user will be prompted to choose a category of words to practice.
The program randomly switches between Spanish-to-English and English-to-Spanish
translations to ensure that the user is well-rounded in their knowledge.
After each translation attempt, the program will indicate whether the answer was correct or not.
At the end of the session, the program will display the user's score as a percentage of correct answers.
The user may then choose to continue practicing or quit the program.
The flashcard data is stored in plain text files with a .txt extension.
Each line of the file contains a pair of words separated by a colon.
The program reads the data from these files and
creates a HashMap where the keys are the Spanish words and the values are the English translations.

To use the program, simply run the Flashcards.java file in your preferred Java development environment.
The program will prompt you to enter the correct translation for each word.
